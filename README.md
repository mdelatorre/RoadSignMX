# Mexico road signs preset for RoadSigns JOSM plugin

[RoadSigns](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/RoadSigns) is a plugin for **JOSM** that offers a GUI for selecting traffic signs from a list of coutry presets. You simple click on the road sign images and you can generate combinations of signs and tagging suggestions. The plugin has limited number of presets. So I created the Mexico road signs preset. :mexico:

## RoadSignsMX installation 

To install the Mexico preset follow these instructions:
<br />
1. Search for the following key entry <code>'''plugin.roadsigns.presets'''</code> in the JOSM advanced preferences. (available in expert mode).
2. Click on the '''Edit''' button in the lower left of the window.
3. Click the '''+''' button to add a new entry.
4. Select the new entry and add the following keys/values. Where PATH is the URI where you have installed this preset.   

| Key          | Value                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| code         | MX                          |
| display-name | Mexico                      |
| preset-path  | <PATH>/roadsignpresetMX.xml |
| icon-path    | <PATH>/images/              |

## Development stage
